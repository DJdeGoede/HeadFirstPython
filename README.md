## third - The support material for the 3rd Edition of Head First Python.

The book assumes you have created a folder called `Learning` which contains most of the Jupyter Notebooks as we well as assorted `*.py` files used in the book. A few additional subfolders exist within `Learning`, namely `swimdata`, `swimdata2`, `webapp`, and `charts`. If you follow along with the book, you'll end up creating the same (or a very similar) folder structure to this one. 

Unlike the folder structure used in the book, this repository is *organised by chapter* to make it easier to find each chapter's files/resources. To ensure the notebooks in the individual chapter folders work, some of the subfolders from `Learning` might be repeated (e.g., `swimdata`). This shouldn't really be a problem, especially if you are following along with the book and creating the folder structure as you go.
